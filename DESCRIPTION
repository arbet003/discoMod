Description: Given gene expression (or other 'omics features) measured on two 
    phenotype groups, model-based clustering methods are used to identify 
    "modules" (sub-networks of correlated genes) separately within each group. Various 
    tests are included for assessing whether the correlation structure within a module 
    differs between the two groups. P-values are calculated using permutations.
